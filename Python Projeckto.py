Create a Simple Management System:
One student who enter name and surname correctly
should write "Welcome" on the screen with print. The student
has the right to enter his / her name and surname incorrectly 3 times.
For more than 3 incorrect entries, the system shuts down and
the message "Please try again later" should be printed on the screen.
5 courses should be created and these courses should be kept in a list.
All of these lessons should be taken from the user.
The student can take a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 lessons.
This student can not take less than 3 courses.
Otherwise, the message "You failed in class" should be returned
to the student by using the return statement.
The student must choose one of these courses and take an exam.
Add the grades from this course to a dictionary and
keep the student's grades in this dictionary as Midterm, Final, and
Project grades.
Example: "Midterm": 38, "Final": 66, "Project":89
Percentages for grades
Midterm Exam %100
Final %50
Project %20
Determine a course passing grade according to the grades received.
For notes:
If the grade is bigger than 90, the student should gets AA.
If 70 < grade < 90 BB
If 50 < grade < 70 CC
If 30 < grade < 50 DD
If the grade less than 30, the student should gets FF.
If the student has received FF, he / she should print
his / her failure on the screen.
